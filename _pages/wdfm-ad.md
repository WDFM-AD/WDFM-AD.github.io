The **Workshop on Distillation of Foundation Models for Autonomous Driving (WDFM-AD)** focuses on advancing the state of the art in deploying large foundation models—such as vision-language models (VLMs) and generative AI (GenAI) models—into autonomous vehicles through efficient distillation techniques. Building on the success of our previous workshops on large language and vision models for autonomous driving, WDFM-AD aims to bring together researchers and industry professionals to explore innovative approaches that accelerate the safe, efficient, and scalable adoption of cutting-edge AI technologies in autonomous vehicles. 

The workshop will cover a wide range of topics, including but not limited to:  
- Foundation Models for Autonomous Driving
- Knowledge Distillation for Autonomous Driving  
- Small Language Models for Autonomous Driving  
- Vision-Language Models for Autonomous Driving  
- Generative AI Models for Autonomous Driving  
- Multimodal Motion Prediction and Planning  
- Domain Adaptation and Transfer Learning in Autonomous Driving  
- Multimodal Fusion for Autonomous Driving
- Trustworthy Machine Learning for Autonomous Driving   
- Other Applications of Language or Vision Models in Autonomous Driving  
- Surveys and Prospective Papers for Autonomous Driving
