The **2nd Workshop on Distillation of Foundation Models for Autonomous Driving (WDFM-AD)** focuses on advancing the state of the art in deploying large foundation modelsâ€”such as vision-language models (VLMs) and generative AI (GenAI) modelsâ€”into autonomous vehicles through efficient distillation techniques. Building on the success of our previous workshops on large language and vision models for autonomous driving, WDFM-AD aims to bring together researchers and industry professionals to explore innovative approaches that accelerate the safe, efficient, and scalable adoption of cutting-edge AI technologies in autonomous vehicles.
